1. A class is an extendable program code to create objects

2. In a class, different Access Modifiers are used (Public, Private and Protected). A class can have multiple public, protected, or private labeled sections. A public member is accessible from anywhere outside the class but within a program. A private member variable or function cannot be accessed, or even viewed from outside the class. Only the class and neighbouring functions can access private members. A protected member variable or function is very similar to a private member but it provides one additional benefit that they can be accessed in child classes which are called derived classes

3. A class is used to create and define the behaviour of objects depending on Abstraction

4. Each instance of a class (object) will allocate memory to store it's own set of data. But all those objects share the same set of member functions.

5. You can find the class delclared below.
     ```
     #include <string>
     using namespace std;
     class bankAccount {
      private:
       string name;
       string number;
       double balance;

      public:
       bankAccount();
       bankAccount(const string & nam, const string & num, double bal);
       void show();
       void deposit(double n);
       void withdraw(double n);
       ~bankAccount();
     };
```

6. Constructors are called to initiate an object, a constructor is called automatically if no constructor is explicitly called, while destructors are called to delete the object or when the object expires

7. bankAccount();
```
     bankAccount(const string & nam, const string & num, double bal);
     };
```

8. A default constructor either has no arguments or has defaults for all the arguments. Having a default constructor enables you to declare objects without initializing them, even if youâ€™ve already defined a custom constructor

9. Using getters:
     ```
       #ifndef STOCK20_H_
       #define STOCK20_H_
       #include <string>
       using namespace std;
       class Stock {
       private:
           string company;
           long shares;
           double share_val;
           double total_val;
           void set_tot() { total_val = shares * share_val; }
       public:
           Stock();
           Stock(const string & co, long n, double pr);
           ~Stock() {};
           void buy(long num, double price);
           void sell(long num, double price);
           void update(double price);
           void show() const;
           const Stock & topval(const Stock & s) const;
           //Added methods
           int numshares() const { return shares; }
           double shareval() const { return share_val; }
           double totalval() const { return total_val; }
           const string & co_name() const { return company; }
       };
```


10. this is a pointer of member functions and used to refer to relative objects
    *this is used to return reference to the calling object
